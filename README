need to figure out safety's and penalties



extra points punts and runs are left.

doing extra points and punts first might be a good idea
this should eliminate 4000 entries in like 10 lines of code and leave you with only runs
runs only need to take in the runner in "firstTouch" which should be the [1] of any runnning
play(probbably need to check that)
tackler should already been taking care of
don't worry about stray periods at the end of names it happens just try and get
only names in the firstTouch thing if possilbe

common run looks like this:
['7:12', 's.mack', 'left', 'guard', 'to', 'jax', '37', 'for', '3', 'yards']
then theres one for right guard and up the middle
where they ran is unimportant
as is where they end up unless its a touchdown
yardline of start is recorded so all you need is the name and how far they ran
if they fumble set the fumble flag and make the second touch whoever came up with it
don't worry about the fact that that won't take into account which team gets the ball
that's not an issue since we don't care only that they fumbled who forced it
and the second touch being whoever gets it just so we can see who recovers
the most fumbles for a season
whos on d whos on offense is alreadys et
the self.playString can be helpful to see what the raw play looked like
tempPlay and by extension play in your eventual isRun or isPunt func, is a list with the
words split up
most of the time we try and take out useless info but i've left clock time, the first variable
of everything in there since i may want it later.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE TACKLE, it's taken for inthe function at the bottom for at the page
just call that if it isn't called already(it should be)

in summary

firstTouch=runner
secondTouch= fumble recovery
if double handoff firstTouch=final runner
fumble=if he fumbles it
yardsGot=yards gained
touchdown=is there a touchdown

playstring has your original play
tempPLay has it in list form

and that should be all you need to find! try and use the "bob" is in "play[6] style of for
loops it usally helps.

I'd start by splitting the normal left guard right guard and up the middles up and taking
care of them
and then going after the basket cases.


block punts are considered fumbles and not really taken care of. They are
pretty much useless for stat anaylsis anyway

self.incomplete also includes missed field goals and conversions
